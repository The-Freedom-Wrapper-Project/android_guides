# CodePath Android Cliffnotes

Welcome to the open-source [Codepath](http://codepath.com) Android Cliffnotes! Our goal is to become the **central crowdsourced resource** for complete and up-to-date Android content and tutorials. [Just take me to the notes](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki#getting-started)!

[![CodePath](http://i.imgur.com/XgxWfyF.png)](http://codepath.com)

We have guides for everyone whether you are **beginner, intermediate or advanced**. Want to learn how to [use the ActionBar](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Defining-The-ActionBar) or the [ins and outs of fragments](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Creating-and-Using-Fragments)? We got that. Want to learn [about testing](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Android-Testing-Options) or how to [build flexible user interfaces for multiple devices](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Flexible-User-Interfaces)? We got you covered. We don't waste time with the "theoretical approach" from a book. We cover **exactly the things we use every day** as we are developing apps for contracts.

**Need Help?** Please join the [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codepath-android-guides) for these guides where you can post related questions.

## Motivation

Ever been **frustrated finding information on outdated one-off blog posts and tutorials** that has since become irrelevant? How many times have you been googling only to find your answer on a **2 year old Stack Overflow post**? We believe there's got to be a better way. Why not have a community to work together in creating useful and detailed documentation for every aspect of Android development(or any platform)? 

Read about our [mission to change the way engineers learn new technologies](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/The-CodePath-Goal) and we would love for you to [get involved](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/The-CodePath-Goal#how-do-i-help)! In addition, we are a fledgling startup so if you like this guide and what we are trying to do, please consider following us on twitter [@codepath](https://twitter.com/codepath)!

## We Need Your Help!

We need your help making the guides even better. In particular, here are the easiest ways to contribute:

1. **Update Guides.** Review existing guides and update outdated content, add tips or add/update images
2. **Fill Out Guides.** Find guides that are [simply stubs](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues/2) and fill them out with content.
3. **Create New Guides.** Review the [missing topics list](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues/2) and create new topic guides.

We [maintain a master missing topics list](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues/2) that contains the most important missing topics. Also, look for items in the cliff notes with the **Needs Attention** mark which indicates the guide needs some love. If you see a topic you'd like added, please check the [issues](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/issues) for this repository to let us know.

If you are interested in contributing to our guides, please check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines) first.
